+About Dataset
The dataset comprises text data, including medical question-answer pairs and NLP-type 
models, providing a comprehensive resource for our project. Size and Format: The dataset contains over 
47,457 records in CSV format, totaling 30 GB, offering a substantial volume of data for our analysis

+Data Splitting 
Training and Testing Split: For model training and evaluation, the dataset was divided into training (80%) 
and testing (20%) sets.  
 Validation Set: A validation set was also created to fine-tune the model parameters, ensuring the model’s performance and accuracy.

 +Model training: 
Training Algorithm: 
• The training algorithm employed is Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). 
• SGD is a widely used optimization algorithm that is especially effective for training neural networks. 
Loss Function: 
• The loss function used is Sparse Categorical Cross-Entropy, which is particularly suitable for multi-class 
classification tasks. 
Evaluation Metric 
• Accuracy: The model's performance is assessed using accuracy, which measures the proportion of correctly 
predicted tags out of all predictions made on the test dataset.
